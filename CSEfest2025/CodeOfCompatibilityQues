The Code of Compatibility

Tani was not an ordinary programmer. While others saw logic and numbers as tools, she believed that every human carried a secret code written by the universe — a pattern of digits that shaped their destiny, relationships, and emotions.

To most, numerology was an ancient superstition, but to Tani, it was an algorithm of life. She called it “The Code of Compatibility.”

Every night, Tani experimented with birth dates. She said:

“Every date is a key — a unique combination of cosmic frequencies.”

According to her, every human has two hidden numbers:

1. Root Number

This represents your instincts, your first reactions, the unchanging part of you.
It is calculated from the day of birth (DD):

Add digits of DD

Continue reducing until a single digit (1–9) remains

Example:
27 → 2 + 7 = 9

2. Destiny Number

This represents the path your life will follow — choices, challenges, people you attract.
It is calculated from the full date (DD + MM + YYYY):

Add all digits

Reduce until a single digit remains

Example:
28-10-1992 → 2+8+1+0+1+9+9+2 = 32 → 3+2 = 5



Planetary Friendship Matrix

Each number has Friendly, Enemy, and Neutral numbers.

Number | Friendly        | Enemy           | Neutral
1      | 1,2,3,5,6,9     | 8               | 4,7
2      | 1,2,3,5         | 8,4,9           | 7,6
3      | 1,2,3,5         | 6               | 4,8,7,9
4      | 1,5,7,6         | 2,9,4,8         | 3
5      | 1,2,3,5,6       | -               | 4,7,8,9
6      | 1,4,5,6,7       | 3               | 2,8,9
7      | 1,3,4,5,6       | 2               | 8,7,9
8      | 3,5,7           | 1,2,4,8         | 9
9      | 1,5,3           | 4,2             | 9,7,6,8


Scoring

Tani compared two people's Root numbers and Destiny numbers:

+5 points → if the numbers are Friends

+2 points → if the numbers are Neutral

0 points → if the numbers are Enemies

Total score = Root score + Destiny score
(Max score = 10)


Compatibility Category

9–10 → Highly Compatible
6–8  → Compatible
3–5  → Neutral
0–2  → Conflicting


Your Task

Write a program that measures the Code of Compatibility between you and another person using their birth dates.

Input Format
DD1 MM1 YYYY1
DD2 MM2 YYYY2

Example:

10 Highly Compatible

Sample Input
28 10 1992
25 07 1991

Sample Output
10 Highly Compatible
